<b>A Bitcoin Wallet With Extra Features!</b> This wallet is built upon the existing popular Bitcoin Android wallet, but you can also use this wallet to exchange and pay to altcoins using ShapeShift integration. You can also export your transactions for accounting purposes.

<b>SHAPESHIFT</b>

ShapeShift integration allows you to pay to alternative coins such as Peercoin or Litecoin with your Bitcoin. Simply scan a QR code, follow a payment link, or enter an address for a coin of choice. You can specify a Bitcoin amount or an amount in the other currency. When you send Bitcoin your funds will automatically be exchanged and sent. It couldn't be any simpler!
